#Requires python-2.6 or higher.
--- Required Yum Packages:
python-sqlobject
ATpy
fuse-python

--- Usage:

Create a new, empty database:

python NGAS_fs.py <mountdir>

Fill database with contents from <SERVER_LOCATION>:

python fillDB.py

NOTE: To specify SERVER_LOCATION simply edit lines 13 and 27 from fillDB.py and NGAS_fs.py respectively.

To unmount:
fusermount -u <mountdir>

--- Currently Working:

It is possible to copy a file from the mount point onto a local point. This saves a physical copy of the document with Read-Only permissions.

cp command, will copy item into the DB and display on mount point with Read-Only set by default.

mv command to move an item onto mount point. Will add item to DB and display with Read-Only permissions.

Using vi to create and then edit a file. Will save the file with Read-Only permissions on exit.

rm command, this will remove the file and its properties from the db.
NOTE: This will NOT work on files added via fillDB.py. To allow this, remove the if statement from "def remove(self, path)" at line 676.

rmdir command, this will remove a folder and all of its contents.
WARNING: This will NOT check if a folder is empty prior to removal!

You may view a file of any type so long as you have the nessesary reader.
NOTE: Compressed files can not be read from at current implementation level.


--- Not Currently Working:

chmod command, causes invalid argument error. If run as root causes invalid permissions error...

chown command, causes I/O error but should not be needed.

mv command to rename an item, unlinks file from its data.

truncate command, should have no usage anyway.

link command, will not work on items added via fillDB.py but should not be needed.

symlink command, raises an I/O error but should not be needed.
